            <h1>Project Calculator</h1>
        </div>
        <hr>
        <div class="intro my-3">
            <p>I have created this Calculator just to test my skills on the tkinter and believe me that it is very easy
                with some line you can create such type of GUI, also it will give you a push to explore the tkinter
                frame work and allow you to create some more projects on your own.<br>
                Here is the look of our calculator</p>
        </div>



        <div class="cotainer d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
            <img class='images' src="../../images/calc_img.png" alt="calculator Image">
        </div>

        <div class="Sub-content my-5">
            <div class="sub-heading">
                <h2>Starting the development of the calculator GUI</h2>
            </div>
            <p>Now as you have seen the image of the calculator so the basic flow of the work has been cleared that is
                this GUI is having two parts the first where we will display the output and the second part is where we
                will place the buttons</p>

            <ol>
                <li>Creating the constructor</li>
                <div class="cotainer d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
                    <img class='images' src="" alt="calculator Image">
                </div>
                <p>This constructor demands for the two parameters that is the width and the height of the GUI.Now in
                    the first line I have created the object of the Tk, then in the next three lines I have fixed the
                    size of the GUI. Then with wm_iconbitmap I have placed the icon image which will be displayed on the
                    top left of the GUI and in the next I have given the title to the GUI "Calculator".Then I have
                    created two frames that is f_1 and f_2, so the f_1 frame is for the entry widget where I will
                    display the output and in the second frame f_2 I will place the Buttons.Then in the second last line
                    I hace created the string text variable for the entry widget and in the last line I have created a
                    empty string variable which will contain the content of the entry widget.</p>

                <li>Creating the entry widget</li>
                <div class="cotainer d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
                    <img class='images' src="" alt="calculator Image">
                </div>
                <p>
                    To create the entry widget here I have created a separate method and its name is entry_window. It is
                    very simple to understand that in the first line I have packed the frame f_1 and its location is on
                    the top of the GUI and it will fill the x-axis. In the next lines I have created the entry widget
                    and packed it in the frame f_1.
                </p>


                <li>Putting the buttons in the GUI</li>
                <div class="cotainer d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
                    <img class='images' src="" alt="calculator Image">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Here I have created the buttons for the calculator so here I have used the for loop for the this
                    purpose and you can do the same thing without the for loop too.
                    So in the first line I have packed the frame f_2 and given a location in such a way that it will
                    cover all the area except the frame f_1 where I have placed the entry widget.
                    Then you will see a list named as button_lt where I have stored the labels of the buttons and inside
                    this list I have inserted six more list where each contains the three labels.
                    After that I have created the for loop to place the buttons in the GUI and here I have used the grid
                    method and also I have binded every button with a funtion named as click. So basically when some
                    will click on a button then this function will call and it will perform some operations.
                </p>


                <li>Understanding the functionality of the buttons</li>
                <div class="cotainer d-flex justify-content-center my-5">
                    <img class='images' src="" alt="calculator Image">
                </div>
                <p>Now inside the method buttons_calculation there is a function called click. Now if you have read the
                    above content then you have noticed that this function has been binded to every button. Now when
                    user will click on the button this funton will store the label of the button in the variable x and
                    the same thing I have written in the first line. Then I have used the if statement to check that
                    whether the value of the x is equal to c or not, if it is true then clear the entry widget. Then I
                    have used elif statement which checks that if x is equal to = then update the 'text_on_screen'
                    variable where I have used eval. Now in the else statement I have written the two lines which will
                    add the text_on_screen and the label of the button which has been stored in the x variable. Then
                    update the entry widget screen.</p>
            </ol>
